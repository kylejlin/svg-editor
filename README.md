# SVGEditor
An SVG Editor I threw together in a pinch.

Click a marker to toggle selection.

Ctrl-d: delete selected markers.

Ctrl-D: delete all markers.

Ctrl-p: create a <polygon> with selected markers.

Ctrl-o: create coordinates of selected markers.

Ctrl-O: render the highlighted coordinates.

Ctrl-s: select markers corresponding to the highlighted coordinates.

Ctrl-S: unselect markers corresponding to the highlighted coordinates.

Ctrl-h: Experimental: color selector.
